# Code_Refactor

## Description 

This repository started with an existing code and was refacted to increase web accessibility. Horiseon Social Media Services wants their site to be more optimized for all search engines. With the help of Visual Studio Code, we are able to format the prewritten code to meet their expectations.

A great start was to give several of the <div> titles in the html a semantic tag. Once the semantic tags were issues, classes were set to move foward in working with the CSS file. As there were several repetitive tags in the existing CSS, grouping those together with one class file removed the previous looping tags. 

The goal was not to change anything with the way the website was presented, as it has a catching image hero at the top and a navigation bar that leads you to the sections showcasing their online marketing and management skills.

## Installation

In order to start creating a more accessible website, downloading Visual Studio Code is necessary. Simply go to their website at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Follow the steps to download on Windows or Mac. Once the program is downloaded, transfer the Develop file from the UCF FT Coding Boot Camp repository. 

Work from the index.html and css tabs to start condensing the code for better accessibility.

## Usage 

Visual Studio Code was used to edit a pre-existing code from Horiseon Social Media Services. The site's accessibility was improved by cleaning up the code.
